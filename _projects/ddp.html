<p>
While adaptive control algorithms for disturbances and stochastic errors with upper bounds have been extensively studied, we delve into uncharted territory—consensus amidst measurement errors with unknown bounds.
<!-- </p>

<p> -->
Traditional strategies for handling disturbances fall short in the face of measurement errors, as these errors scale with control gain, unlike external disturbances. 
<!-- In this work we tackle the task of ensuring converged trajectories with constant measurement bias—a challenge surpassing the robustness case of disturbances. -->
</p>

<p>
   We develop an adaptive distributed control law using Lyapunov methods for consensus of networked double integrator systems [<a href="pdf/ddpPaper2.pdf">Paper</a>]. 
   The agents measure relative positions over a time-varying, undirected graph with an unknown and constant sensor bias corrupting the measurements. 
   Our approach ensures that position consensus is achieved exponentially in
   addition to accurate individual bias estimation. We leverage recent advances
   in collective initial excitation based results in adaptive estimation and
   develop conditions connecting bipartite graphs and collective initial
   excitation. We demonstrate our algorithms in simulations on a network of double integrators with both Biartite and non-Bipartite local
   communication network topology and biased measurements.

<!-- <p>
In the literature on consensus with errors, adaptive control algorithms in the presence of an upper bound on disturbances and stochastic errors have
been widely studied. But what happens to consensus in the presence of measurement errors with unknown bounds? This problem is addressed in this project. Further, strategies for handling disturbance do not usually fare well for the case of measurement errors simply due to the fact that the measurement errors scale with the control gain while disturbances external to the system do not. This makes ensuring bounded trajectories with constant measurement bias a much harder problem than the disturbance robustness case.

<p>
We have developed a model independent Lyapunov based decentralized control algorithm which ensures that networked Euler-Lagrangian system track a time varying trajectory in the presence of a non-zero, unknown sensor bias in relative measurements. 
We do not assume knowledge of upper bounds on the measurement errors in this work. 
We devise a composite adaptive controller for consensus that achieves an exponential convergence with exponential bias estimation. 
Simulation results on a six spacecraft formation corroborate our theoretical findings.
