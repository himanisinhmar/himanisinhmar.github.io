<h3> Welcome </h3>

<p>
Hello and thank you for visiting my homepage. 
I am a final year student enrolled in Integrated Bachelor's and Master's program of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay (Mumbai, India).
</p>

<p>
I am fascinated by space exploration and autonomous aerial vehicles.
My research interests lie in the domain of cooperative control, non linear adaptive control, and autonomous guidance & navigation of aerial vehicles.
I am also keen to work on amalgamation of reinforcement learning and decentralized control of multi-agent system in uncertain environment.
Currently, I am working with Prof. Srikant Sukumar, Systems and Control Engineering at IIT Bombay, 
on developing an adaptive controller for consensus of networked multi agent non linear system under unknown measurement biases.

<p>
Other fields that intrigue me is Astrophysics.
I am fascinated by this colossal and mysterious universe and hence have pursued a minor degree in Physics.
I am an amateur reader and love mystery thrillers.
In my pastime I love to do activities like trekking, camping, playing badminton and writing.
</p>

<p>
I have served as a chief editor for the first ever department newsletter <a href="{{ '/pdf/newsletter.pdf' | relative_url }}">Lift-off</a> of  Aerospace Dept. at IIT Bombay. We have covered diverse issues of importance to the Aerospace industry and published what is hoped would be an interesting read.
