<h3> About Me </h3>


<p>I am a PhD candidate in robotics at Cornell University. My advisor is Professor Hadas Kress-Gazit and I am part of the Verifiable Robotics Research Group. I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Aerospace Engg. from IIT Bombay (Mumbai, India) in 2019.
</p>

<p>I love to work on the unsolved problems in the field of autonomy, minimal field robotics, motion planning, and learning. Currently, I am working on making simple, robust, and reliable swarm robots that achieve task completion with minimal information and restricted individual capabilities. In addition to this, I have also been working on the synthesis of autonomous micron-scale morphing robots for encapsulating biological systems. These tiny robots would have the ability to be injected into the patient and stop the tumors in their tracks when surgery is not an option.
</p>

<p>I have completed a minor degree in physics and currently pursuing a minor in computer science. In my free time I like to go runnig or read a sci-fi book. I have served as a chief editor for the first ever department newsletter “Lift-off” of  Aerospace Dept. at IIT Bombay. We have covered diverse issues of importance to the Aerospace industry and published what is hoped would be an interesting read.
