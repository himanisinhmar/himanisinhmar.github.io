<h3> About Me </h3>


<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my homepage. I am a first year MAE PhD student at Cornell University. I  completed my Bachelor's and Master's program in Aerospace Engg. from IIT Bombay (Mumbai, India) in 2019.
</p>

<p>I am fascinated by robots and autonomous vehicles. My research interests lie in the domain of multi-agent control, adaptive control, robotics and learning. For my master's thesis, I worked with Prof. Srikant Sukumar, Systems and Control Engg. at IIT Bombay, on developing an adaptive controller for consensus of networked multi agent system under unknown measurement biases.
</p>

<p>Another field that intrigues me is astronomy and so I have completed a minor degree in physics. I love reading fiction and mystery novels. In my free time I like to run and go bicycling. I have served as a chief editor for the first ever department newsletter “Lift-off” of  Aerospace Dept. at IIT Bombay. We have covered diverse issues of importance to the Aerospace industry and published what is hoped would be an interesting read.
