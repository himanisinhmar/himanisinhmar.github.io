<h3> About Me </h3>


<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my homepage. I am an incoming MAE PhD student at Cornell University. I  completed my Bachelor's and Master's program in Aerospace Engg. from IIT Bombay (Mumbai, India) in 2019.
</p>

<p>I am fascinated by space exploration and autonomous aerial vehicles. My research interests primarily lie in the domain of cooperative control, nonlinear adaptive control, and autonomous guidance and navigation of aerial vehicles. I am also keen to work on the amalgamation of reinforcement learning and decentralized control of multi-agent system in an uncertain environment. Currently, I am working with Prof. Srikant Sukumar, Systems and Control Engg. at IIT Bombay, on developing an adaptive controller for consensus of networked multi agent non linear system under unknown measurement biases.

<p>Another field that intrigues me is Astrophysics. I am fascinated by this colossal and mysterious universe and hence have completed a minor degree in Physics. I love reading with an inclination towards mystery and fiction novels. In my free time I love to play badminton, cycle and write poetry. I have served as a chief editor for the first ever department newsletter “Lift-off” of  Aerospace Dept. at IIT Bombay. We have covered diverse issues of importance to the Aerospace industry and published what is hoped would be an interesting read.
