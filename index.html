<!-- <h3> About Me </h3> -->


<p>I am a PhD candidate in robotics at Cornell University under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.verifiablerobotics.com/people/">Hadas Kress-Gazit</a>. I am an active member of the <a href="https://www.verifiablerobotics.com/">
Verifiable Robotics Research Group</a>. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on Systems and Control from <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My research focuses on developing verifiable-safe motion planners and controllers for robotic systems with resource-efficient hardware to address real-world challenges. 
    I utilize insights from diverse fields such as control theory, collective intelligence, formal methods, sensor networks, and optimization. 
    My goal is to advance practical and theoretically grounded solutions to enhance the safety and task completion of robotic systems in unstructured and dynamic unknown environments. 
    By addressing the challenges of scalability, and adaptability in real-world applications, I aim to contribute to cost-effective and efficient control solutions across various domains.
    In addition to this,  I am collaborating with <a href="https://cohengroup.lassp.cornell.edu/">Cohen Group</a>, <a href="https://apsellab.ece.cornell.edu/people/alyssa-apsel/">Apsel Lab</a> and <a href="https://nlabbottcornell.weebly.com/">Laboratory for Molecular engineering</a> to synthesize autonomous micron-scale origami robots that are active at time and length scales comparable to biological microorganisms.

<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I find joy in running or hiking through the woods. 
    I am an avid reader and always eager to engage in discussions about world affairs, human psychology, and philosophy of science.
